# region_app
nested foreach structure that iterates through the application's array data. The first array contains the names of 7 geographic regions. Added Counter to stop adding values to the sum when the counter reaches 25.

This Console APP made in C# was made with the sole purpose to test else, else if and foreach skills learned in Microsoft C# courses.
